This dashboard was designed to analyze airline operational efficiency across carriers, routes, and distance categories using a multi-layered analytical approach.

The analysis focuses on:

- Evaluating Load Factor % trends against total passenger volume to identify demand fluctuations
- Comparing carrier performance across freight, payload, and operational efficiency metrics
- Analyzing route-level traffic concentration to detect high-yield corridors
- Assessing weekday vs weekend performance variability
- Segmenting flight distribution by distance category to understand network structure

The objective was to move beyond KPI tracking and enable deeper exploratory analysis of operational drivers affecting airline profitability and capacity planning.
Backend KPI logic and aggregations were implemented using SQL prior to visualization.
